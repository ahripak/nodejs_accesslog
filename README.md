# Node.js Access Log

### Purpose
Essentially my entry for the Moduleoff competition made by [Mark Kadin](http://mrkadin.com/), see the description: [http://moduleoff.com/contest/do-something-cool-nodejs](http://moduleoff.com/contest/do-something-cool-nodejs)

### Requirements
This module requires [Hostip](http://drupal.org/project/hostip) and [Visualization API](http://drupal.org/project/visualization), along with the [Node.js Integration](http://drupal.org/project/nodejs) module of course.

### More
What it does is it somewhat mimics the behaviors of Google's beta Realtime analytics, that shows current hits on the site and where they originate from. Albeit, Google has a much better handle on this type of featureâ€”but the purpose of this module is to show the ordinary developers can make a module fairly easy that uses Node and a couple contributed modules to do similar asynchronous tasks (like the Realtime analytics) without relying on ajax polling or page refreshes.
